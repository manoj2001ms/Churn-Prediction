# Over View
This repository contains the code and resources for my churn prediction project focused on WiFi services within the telecom industry. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict customer churn, enabling proactive retention strategies to be implemented.
# data 
This repository includes the following data files:
- telecom_customer_churn.csv': Contains customer demographic information such as age, gender,customer status, cgurn reason,payment method etc.,
You can download the dataset from the following link:

# Methodology
I employed various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, ada boosting and gradient boosting to train and evaluate the churn prediction models. Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract meaningful insights from the data and improve model performance.
# Results
After rigorous experimentation and cross-validation, the final model achieved a churn prediction accuracy of over 96%. Additionally, feature importance analysis revealed that factors such as  data usage patterns, and customer tenure were significant predictors of churn.
# Conclusion
This churn prediction project demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches to improve customer retention strategies in the telecom industry. By identifying customers at risk of churn, telecom companies can implement targeted interventions to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce subscriber turnover.
